# dictionaries
# d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}
# This is a dictionary called d with three key-value pairs. The key 'key1' points to the value 1, 'key2' to 2, and so on.

# here's another example. Note the {}.
# Assigning a dictionary with three key-value pairs to residents:
residents = {'Puffin' : 104, 'Sloth' : 105, 'Burmese Python' : 106}

print residents['Puffin']                  # Prints Puffin's room number 104
print residents['Sloth']                   # Prints Sloth's room number 105
print residents['Burmese Python'] # Prints Burmese Python's room number 106
